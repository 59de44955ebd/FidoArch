# FidoArch
A PowerShell script to download Windows ISOs from archive.org.

FidoArch is a clone of [Fido](https://github.com/pbatard/Fido) that instead allows to select and download Windows OS setup ISOs from [archive.org](https://archive.org/), including various legacy systems.

It's basically a fun project, but maybe still useful.
